## Alpaca-Detection-Model-using-Yolo

#Overview
This project implements an object detection and recognition system specifically designed for detecting alpacas in uncontrolled environments. The system is built using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, which has been trained on a custom dataset comprising 142 images of alpacas captured in various uncontrolled settings.
